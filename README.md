# s-ESX Simple ESX Recipe

s-ESX is intended to be a simplified method of installing the fantastic ESX framework in your FiveM server. Instead of tracking down all the resources, adding them and their SQL files, it's a single download, SQL import then crank it up!

This version is built off of ESX 1.2(final).

S-ESX is built upon these awesome scripts:

- [FiveM](https://fivem.net "FiveM")
- [ESX](https://github.com/esx-framework "ESX")
- [Re-Ignited gcphone](https://github.com/Re-Ignited-Development "Re-Ignited gcphone")
- [HumanTree92](https://github.com/HumanTree92 "HumanTree92")
- [TomGrobbe](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu "TomGrobbe")
- [Jacobwi](https://github.com/jacobwi/new_banking "Jacobwi") (Reskin by [ItsManueh](https://github.com/ItsManueh/ModifyUiNewBanking "ItsManueh"))
- Kashacters (repo not available) Fork by [FiveEYZ](https://github.com/FiveEYZ/esx_kashacter "FiveEYZ")

### TO USE Kashacters
1. Enable esx_kashacters in server.cfg
2. Set Config.MultiCharacter to `true` in /[esx]/es_extended/config.lua

This will enable the Kashacters system.  This has to be done on a new database, it's not intended for switching back and forth between the stock ESX and Kash systems, doing so can cause errors and character data being lost.
